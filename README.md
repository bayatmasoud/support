# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 13, 2025**

## Introduction

Blumoj is a simple classified ads platform where users can publish and view listings. This Privacy Policy explains how the platform works and what information you choose to make public when you use our service.

## What Blumoj Is

Blumoj is a hosting platform for classified ads. We provide the technical infrastructure for users to post their listings and connect with each other. We do not collect, process, or use your personal data for any purpose other than displaying the listings you voluntarily choose to publish.

## Information You Provide

When you create an account and publish a listing, you voluntarily provide:

- **Your Name**: Displayed on your listings
- **Email Address**: Publicly displayed for buyers to contact you
- **Phone Number**: Publicly displayed for buyers to contact you
- **Password**: Stored securely to protect your account
- **Listing Details**: Title, description, photos, price, and location

**Important**: By publishing a listing, you are choosing to make your contact information (email and phone) publicly visible to all users. This is the core functionality of the platform - to allow buyers to contact sellers.

## Verification

To reduce spam and increase trust:
- You must verify your email address
- You must verify your phone number

Until verification is complete, only the address from your listing is shown to other users (your contact details remain hidden).

## What We DON'T Do

We want to be clear about what we don't do:

- ❌ We do not track your activity or behavior
- ❌ We do not use analytics or tracking tools
- ❌ We do not share your data with third parties for marketing
- ❌ We do not sell your information
- ❌ We do not use cookies for tracking
- ❌ We do not collect device information beyond what's necessary for the app to function
- ❌ We do not process your data for purposes other than displaying your listings

## How the Platform Works

Think of Blumoj like a digital bulletin board:

1. You create a listing with your contact information
2. We display your listing publicly
3. Interested buyers contact you directly using the information you provided
4. We simply host and display what you choose to publish

## Your Control

You have complete control:

- **Edit Your Listings**: Update or modify your listings anytime through the app
- **Delete Your Listings**: Remove individual listings whenever you want
- **Delete Your Account**: Delete your entire account and all your listings from the app settings

When you delete your account:
- All your listings are immediately removed
- Your account information is permanently deleted
- This action cannot be undone

## Data Security

We implement basic security measures:
- Passwords are encrypted
- Data transmission uses secure HTTPS
- Access to the platform requires authentication

However, remember that any information you include in your listings is public by design.

## Your Responsibilities

When using Blumoj, you are responsible for:

- The accuracy of the information you provide
- The content you publish in your listings
- Complying with applicable laws in Denmark and the European Union

### Prohibited Content

Do not publish:
- Pornographic content
- Abusive, threatening, or hateful content
- Violent content
- Illegal goods or services
- Misleading or false information
- Content that violates others' rights

We reserve the right to remove any listing or suspend accounts that violate these rules.

## GDPR Compliance (European Users)

Under GDPR, you have the right to:

- **Access**: View what information you've published
- **Rectification**: Edit your listings and account information
- **Erasure**: Delete your account and listings at any time
- **Data Portability**: Request a copy of your data

Since you control what you publish, you can exercise most of these rights directly through the app.

**Legal Basis**: We operate on the basis of consent. By creating an account and publishing listings, you consent to making your contact information public. You can withdraw this consent at any time by deleting your listings or account.

## No Special Permissions Required

The Blumoj app does not require special device permissions beyond:
- Internet access (to connect to the platform)
- Camera/photo library (only if you want to add photos to your listings)
- Optional location services (to help you set your listing location)

You remain in control of what permissions you grant.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for users under 16 years of age. If you are under 16, please do not use this platform.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will:
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Notify you through the app or by email if changes are significant

Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## Platform Responsibility

Blumoj acts only as a hosting platform. We:
- Do not verify the accuracy of listings
- Are not responsible for transactions between users
- Are not party to agreements between buyers and sellers
- May remove content that violates our terms
- Will cooperate with law enforcement when legally required
